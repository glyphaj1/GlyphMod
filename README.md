üìÇ File Locations
------------------------------

üîß Modified Configuration File
Depending on your chosen bootstrapper, the script modifies the following file:

- For **Bloxstrap**:  
  `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Bloxstrap\Modifications\ClientSettings\ClientAppSettings.json`

- For **Fishstrap**:  
  `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Fishstrap\Modifications\ClientSettings\ClientAppSettings.json`

This file contains the FastFlags and client settings that control Roblox‚Äôs performance.

---
üíæ Backup Directory
Before any changes are made, Glyph Mod automatically creates a backup of the original configuration.

Backups are stored in timestamped folders such as:

- `ClientSettingsBackup_FPSUnlock` - previous config before using FPS Unlock
- `ClientSettingsBackup_Optimizer` - previous config before using Optimizer
- `ClientSettingsBackup_Checkmark` - previous config before using Checkmark

üìÅ These folders are saved in the **same directory** as the `glyphmod.bat` file, making it easy to find and restore previous settings if needed.

------------------------------
üõ°Ô∏è DISCLAIMER
------------------------------
This tool only applies changes on your local system. It does NOT hack or interact with 
Roblox servers in any way. It is 100% compliant with Roblox‚Äôs Terms of Service.

All changes are client-side only and fully reversible via automatic backups.

------------------------------
üôè Thanks
------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è This entire tool is **highly dependent** on the use of **Bloxstrap** (https://bloxstraplabs.com/)
or **Fishstrap** (https://www.fishstrap.app/).

Without these tools, the modifications made by Glyph Mod will not be applied correctly. 
They provide the custom loader infrastructure that makes advanced Roblox optimization possible.

Massive thanks and appreciation to the developers of **Bloxstrap** and **Fishstrap** 
for making projects like this possible.

Please consider supporting their work too!
