Hi. 

Before using GlyphMod make sure roblox is FULLY CLOSED.

**Don't use the FPS unlocker and the client settings at the same time ( pressing 2 in the software at the same time, it won't work. If you do this use the 'revert' in the software to clear all settings applied.)
Client settings already have in-built FPS unlocker.**

-- Checkmark -- 
To use a client sided checkmark use the software then press more options and checkmark.
Go to your browser go to 'roblox.com' then click your profile at the top left of the roblox page.
For me the URL at the top is 'https://www.roblox.com/users/4747735102/profile'.
Get the number in the middle of the URL in my case the number is '4747735102'.
Copy this number and paste it into the software then press enter.
Launch roblox and you'll have a checkmark.

If this didn't work click revert and redo all these steps above.
